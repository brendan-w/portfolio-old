					This IR remote control was made to operate any function of any device. Using an Arduino Nano, tables of IR codes can be programmed into the flash memory. When a button is pressed, the remote begins iterating through the desired IR codes. While the code tables are by no means complete, several of the market-leading TV manufacturers are already compiled into the software.
				</p>
				<p>
					Internally, IR codes are stored in a format similar to <a href='http://www.remotecentral.com/features/irdisp2.htm'>Pronto Hex</a>. However, to conserve memory, they are stored using a dictionary and byte-length based compression, and are decompressed upon retrieval. This technique was inspired by the <a href='https://github.com/adafruit/Flora-TV-B-Gone/'>TV-B-Gone</a>, a similar project that sends OFF commands. As time goes on, I intend to expand the command library to make it control a wider array of devices.
