						<p>
							DDL creator was written for Windworks Design and the theatrical lighting community. It creates and edits files used by a computerized theatrical lighting console. These control files, known as DDL (Device Definition Language) files, are encoded in ASCII. Specifically, they define the layout and addressing of a theater light's various functions.
						<p>
						</p>
							Since the DDL files are encoded in ASCII, this program taught me the basics of parsing and handling text. Due to the linear structure of DDL's, error correction is also included in this parsing process. This software reads and parses DDL's one line at a time, isolates keywords and values, and records these values in user-defined data types.
						</p>
						<p>
							In essence, this software was my first major programming project. I went through many versions as I acquired more skills and knowledge. It taught me the basic prinicpals of programming, and boosted my interest in the topic. Unfortunately, because this software is company property, I cannot release compiled binary files. Alternatively, I have included two functions from the source code.

						<font size=5><b>Laser Controller</b></font>
						<br>
						<font size=2>Language: Microsoft Visual Basic 6</font>
						<br>
						<font size=2>Status: In Progress</font>
						<br>
						<br>
						<img src="Laser sml.jpg" align="right">
						<p>
							The Laser controller was created for personal use with a laser show projector. It manages an array of points and effects in order to create laser images and beam patterns for laser shows. Since laser projectors create 2D artwork, this software sends both X and Y coordinates through the parallel port using a file called IO.DLL.
						</p>
						<p>
							This software has three key design features. One of which, is the effects stack. This stack is a list of modifiers that can be applied to the drawn points. This enables the user to create complex patterns and images with relative ease, and obviates the need for an animation timeline. The program also has an interpolation option, which will add interstitial points at a set density. Because of these two features, the program is mathematically intensive. The source file below contains the functions for applying the "radial duplication" effect to image drawn by the user.
						</p>
						<p>
							The controller also features a live output display, which presents the user with the real time data being sent to the projector. A rudimentary render engine displays this data similar to how it would be projected in real life. The video below shows both the projector, and the live output display operating to produce various effects.

						<font size=5><b>Database Terminal</b></font>

						<p>
							The database terminal was also created for personal use. Largely intended to organize and access notes and text information, this software provides a quick way to search for information in a database file. I created a simple text structure for the storage and retrieval of many entries, and also built in several options dictating the behavior of the search.
						</p>
						<p>
							Along with the database functions of this program, there is also a calculator for convenience. It performs multistep computations on string expressions, and adheres to the order of operations. This entailed a fair amount of parsing, compared to the primary search engine.

						<font size=5><b>Sound Effects Player</b></font>

						<font size=2>Status: In Progress</font>
						<br>

						<img src="Sound sml.jpg" align="right">
						<p>
							This program is an example of a project that I am currently developing. When finished, it is intended to playback multiple sound effects for theatrical productions. It uses the Minim Audio and ControlP5 libraries to generate sound and a GUI. Because each "Sound Track" can be represented as an instance of a single class, this project is teaching me more about working with arrays of objects. While not completed, I do intend to continue work on this program.
