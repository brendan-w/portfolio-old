				This tool visualizes Javascript as it executes in a web browser. After supplying the script, the user can watch the computer execute each line of code. As it runs, a heatmap is built which displays the total number of times a each line was executed. One-off commands can also be issued, allowing for experimentation with larger libraries.

			<div class='col'>
				The execution detection is done by injecting callbacks before (or in) every javascript statement. This is done with UglifyJS2, which creates a syntax tree from the users Javascript. This tree is then modified by adding new nodes which define the various callbacks, and is recompiled to Javascript text.
