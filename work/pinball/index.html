					This application is yet another PC pinball machine. It uses processing for its user input and graphics, and JBox2D for the physics simulation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Its most unique attraction is a direction-lottery machine. When the player shoots a ball into this machine, it holds the ball, picks one of the 7 directions at random, and fires the ball back onto the playing field. This game also features 3 portals, where the user can shoot a ball in one portal, and have it exit on another part of the field.

				<p>
					Initially, all elements were drawn with Processing (to facillitate integration with the physics engine). However, once the elements were positioned and modeled in JBox2D, many of them were rendered into the background image for better performance. While most of the elements are polygonal, and were easy to model, a few curves were needed to provide smooth motion. To accomplish this, the program simply generates various segments of an ellipses circumference.
