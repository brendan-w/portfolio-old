Polygon: A closed figure whose sides are line segments that intersect only at their endpoints.

Polygon Equations:

N = Number of sides
(N-2)180 = Sum of all angles in the polygon
[(N-2)180]/N = The measure of one angle in a regular polygon.

3 sided polygon = (triangle): 180 degrees total.
4 sided polygon = (quadrilateral): 360 degrees total.
5 sided polygon = (pentagon): 540 degrees total.
6 sided polygon = (hexagon): 720 degrees total.
7 sided polygon = (heptagon): 900 degrees total.
8 sided polygon = (octagon): 1080 degrees total.
9 sided polygon = (enneagon): 1260 degrees total.
10 sided polygon = (decagon): 1440 degrees total.
