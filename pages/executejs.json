			"This tool visualizes Javascript as it executes in a web browser. After supplying the script, the user can watch the computer execute each line of code. As it runs, a heatmap is built which displays the total number of times a each line was executed. One-off commands can also be issued, allowing for experimentation with larger libraries.",
			"The execution detection is done by injecting callbacks before (or in) every javascript statement. This is done with UglifyJS2, which creates a syntax tree from the users Javascript. This tree is then modified by adding new nodes which define the various callbacks, and is recompiled to Javascript text."
